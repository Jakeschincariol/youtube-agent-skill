"""retention.py - read a YouTube Studio audience-retention export and find the leaks.

    python3 retention.py retention.csv
    python3 retention.py retention.csv --transcript transcript.srt   # names what was said at each drop
    python3 retention.py retention.csv --json
    python3 retention.py retention.csv --axis seconds                 # force the axis if it is misread

Get the file from Studio: Analytics -> a video -> Engagement -> the audience-retention chart ->
the download icon -> "Audience retention". Two columns, a position (percent or seconds) and a
percentage still watching.

It reports three things, because they are three different problems with three different fixes:
  HOOK LEAK    what you lost in the first 30 seconds
  CLIFFS       single steep drops - a specific moment people left at
  SLIDE        the steady bleed rate across the flat middle

With --transcript it prints what you were saying at each cliff, which is the only version of this
report you can act on without scrubbing the video yourself.
